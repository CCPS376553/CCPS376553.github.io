    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am working toward becoming a better version of myself. In my personal life I want to be someone who is reliable and organized. In my professional life I want to be known as someone who is responsible and on top of things.
I am working toward these goals by practicing doing these things everyday. I am doing this by focusing more on myself and trying my hardest in everything I do. An example of me working toward this goal is to do something when I say I'm going to do it.
Values I consider most necessary for my success are confidence and perseverance. These are important because if you are confident then you can believe that you can do anything and you won't give up easily. If you have perseverance then you will strive towards what you want no matter what it takes.
Short-term goals I hope to accomplish in the near future is being more responsible in many different things. An example of this would be with school work or in my own personal life. If I start being more responsible now then it will benefit me in the future when I'm an adult.
Character traits I want to be known for are being dependable and light hearted. Achievements I want to be known for are having a high GPA or being a prodigy. All of these are good quality traits which is what I want to be known for.</p>
